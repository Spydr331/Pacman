# Pacman

Trying to recreate the pacman game with correct ghost AI.

Currently the way to change the ghost behavior is to press key commands that are written in the textarea, there is a game over state but no win state. 

There is also a debug checkbox to see where the ghosts are trying to move to, it helps to understand all their AI this way.
