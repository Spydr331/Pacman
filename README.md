# Pacman

Trying to recreate the pacman game with correct ghost AI using the Pacman Dossier website.

Currently the way to change the ghost behavior is to press key commands that are written in the textarea, there is a game over state but no win state. 

There is also a debug checkbox to see where the ghosts are trying to move to, it helps to understand all their AI this way.

## TODO LIST:
* Add new levels
* Create win screen
* Create lose screen
* Get ghosts to change behavior automatically rather than manually
* Add ghost death animation
* Add ghost house animations
* Add speed changes for the characters in different states and locations on the map
